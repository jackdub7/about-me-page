    <h1>Education</h1>
    <p>As a resident of Tucson, Arizona, I received my high school education in the Vail Unified School District.  I graduated from Empire High School in 2021.<br />  Along with graduating top 10 in my class, I also was able to finish 6 Advanced Placement courses.  I now attend Brigham Young University and plan on<br />graduating in 2027.  I am currently studying cybersecurity and am an academic Sophmore.</p>
    <h1>Hobbies</h1>
    <p>I have quite a few hobbies, as I have a deep desire to learn whatever I can.  The first of said hobbies is swimming.  I have competitively swam since I<br />was about eight years old.  In that time I have swam for four different teams.  These are:<br />-Rockwall Aquatic Center of Excellence (RACE) <br />-Tucson Ford Dealer's Aquatics<br />-Flying Fish of Arizona (FAST)<br />-Brigham Young University (BYU)<br />Apart from swimming, I am also a big lover of video games, especially Mario Kart and Super Smash Bros.  I have been playing the Nintendo since I<br />was super little.  Those are the main things I play, but with that interest in video games, I was guided to also want to work with computers.</p> 
    <h1>Family</h1>
    <p>My family is decently sized, I would like to beleive not too large nor too small.  There are my parents, Jared and Sandra, then my three little sisters,<br />Mikaela, Alexis, and Camila.  We have also had the opprotunity to have three dogs, a German Shepard named Loki, a Maltese/Shi'Tsu named Brady, and<br />a German Shepard/Doberman named Odin.</p>
